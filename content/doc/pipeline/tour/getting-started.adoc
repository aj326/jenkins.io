This guided tour introduces you to the basics of using Jenkins and its main
feature, Jenkins Pipeline. This tour uses the "standalone" Jenkins distribution,
which runs locally on your own machine.

=== Prerequisites

For this tour, you will require:

* A machine with:
** 256 MB of RAM, although more than 512MB is recommended
** 10 GB of drive space (for Jenkins and your Docker image)
* The following software installed:
** Java 8 (either a JRE or Java Development Kit (JDK) is fine)
** https://docs.docker.com/[Docker] (navigate to *Get Docker* at the top of the
   website to access the Docker download that's suitable for your platform)

=== Download and run Jenkins

. http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war[Download Jenkins].
. Open up a terminal in the download directory.
- (Recommended) Verify the downloaded file checksum by comparing http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war.sha256[the sha256 checksum from the server] with the one generated using your downloaded local file. You can generate sha256 checksum on https://superuser.com/questions/245775/is-there-a-built-in-checksum-utility-on-windows-7/898377#898377[Windows], https://itsfoss.com/checksum-tools-guide-linux[Linux], and https://tutorials.technology/solved_errors/14-Mac-OS-X-how-to-generate-md5-sha1-sha256-checksums-from-command-line.html[Mac]. 
. Run `java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8080`.
. Browse to `\http://localhost:8080`.
. Follow the instructions to complete the installation.

When the installation is complete, you can start putting Jenkins to work!
